        <h1> Paul George </h1>
        <p> My favorite celebrity is Paul George he is a basketball player in the NBA.He is 33 years old and has no championships.He is my favorite celebrity because of his influence on the sport of basketball.He was one of the first people above the height of 6,9 to be dribbling the ball as if they're a point guard.His smooth demeanor and play style is mesmerising to watch and that's why he's my favorite player.</p>

        <p> You should care about Pual George because he is one of the many people who was on the all star team several times but has never won a championshiop.He is in my opinion one of the greatest to ever play.
            He is also the smoothest player above the height of 6,7 in the league or to ever play period.
